# What Language I used 
I used Python through Jupyter notebook Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using Keras and Tensorflow as a backend 
# important Note
 the file LSTM_for_Energy WON'T work from the first time becuase it exceeds 10 MB so just reload it and it will work perfectly 
# Description
Created a program to forecast the energy usage for specific areas using different deep learning models such as Time Series Analysis, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
# What I learned 
How to analyze the data obtained over a long span of time and observe the trends and seasonality in it and how to interpret it as well as predicting the energy for unseen years and measure its accuracy.
